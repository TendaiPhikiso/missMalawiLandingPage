## Summary
Miss Malawi 2022 has commenced & I thought of taking this opportunity to re-design their website for fun. Once again I did not create any lo-fi prototypes, I just decided to follow my creative instincts & design the website based on whatever came to my mind. 

Let's say the design was to be developed... The contestant images in the header section would rotate anti-clockwise automatically; however, if the automation is too fast, the user can use the arrow buttons to navigate through profiles of each contestant. The button pointing down rotates the images of the contestants anti-clockwise, while the other rotates the images clockwise.

I have no rationale for placing the buttons in that manner. I just think it's unique.
